            <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this paper is to explore how security testing can be integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to protect government platforms from cyber threats. 
      This paper examines security testing in the SDLC, reviews common cyber threats, explains penetration testing as a key security method, and discusses the Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) for identifying vulnerabilities. 
        Real-world examples, such as ransomware attacks on government systems, highlight the urgent need for stronger security practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        I chose this topic for my Research Methods class because cybersecurity is a growing concern in Kazakhstan. 
        Government systems are frequent targets for cyberattacks, which can leak personal data and disrupt essential services. 
        By focusing on security testing in government software, this research aims to make digital services more secure and provide useful insights for developers and policymakers working to improve security strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Required Skills</h2>
    <p>
       Writing this paper required knowledge of cybersecurity principles like penetration testing and ethical hacking, as well as an understanding of the SDLC, academic research, and security frameworks such as ISSAF and OWASP. 
       I completed this work as part of my <strong>Research Methods</strong> class at <strong>Nazarbayev University</strong> to contribute to increasing the awareness on the importance of securing digital government services.
