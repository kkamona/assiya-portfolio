            <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The increasing digitization of government services worldwide, including in Kazakhstan, highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures. 
        This paper addresses the integration of security testing into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to protect governmental platforms from cyber threats. 
        As governments handle sensitive citizen data, ensuring security through penetration testing and structured assessment frameworks is vital for national stability, trust, and efficiency. 
        This research is applicable globally, as cyber threats target public infrastructure regardless of location.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        I chose this topic for my Research Methods class because cybersecurity is a growing concern, particularly in Kazakhstan, where digital transformation is rapidly expanding. 
        Government institutions are primary targets for cyberattacks, which can compromise sensitive citizen data, disrupt essential services, and erode public trust. 
        By advocating for integrating security testing into government software, this research contributes to making digital services safer and more reliable. 
        The findings can guide policymakers and developers in enhancing security strategies, ultimately benefiting society by safeguarding personal information and critical infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This paper explores security testing within the SDLC, focusing on government software platforms. 
        It reviews existing literature on cybersecurity threats, discusses penetration testing as a key security assessment technique, and highlights the 
        Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) as a structured approach to identifying vulnerabilities. 
        The study emphasizes the importance of integrating security measures before and after software deployment to mitigate cyber risks. 
        Real-world examples of government cyberattacks, such as ransomware incidents affecting police departments and city infrastructures, underscore the urgent need for improved security practices.
